<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>
  I spent 5 years as an engineer and manager at <a href='https://www.blueapron.com'>Blue Apron</a> building operations & logistics systems, helping the company scale its order fulfillment capability and <i>deliver one box of fresh food per second</i>. Amongst many other things, I:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead the unification of order management and fulfillment systems to reduce technical debt while increasing Blue Apron's product offering, fulfillment partnerships and delivery capabilities,</li>
  <li>Supported the increase of on-time deliveries for hundreds of thousands of weekly packages while decreasing shipping costs,</li>
  <li>Implemented the software foundation of what became the company‚Äôs strategic solution for scaling its packing and shipping operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I also volunteered as a mentor in <a href="https://codeinteractive.org/accelerator/">Code/Interactive's Tech Career Accelerator Program</a>, a 2-year program for students from underrepresented groups studying computer science at the City University of New York, and coached several women successfully transitioning their career into software engineering.
</p>

<p>
  Before Blue Apron, I was leading the development team at <a href='projects/mostro.html'>Mostro</a> where we made infrastructure monitoring software that brought usability and ease of setup to a world of complex, often critical problems. <a href='projects/mostro.html'>Learn more about what problems it solved and why it failed</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My first job in New York was with the incredible team at <a href='projects/devpost.html'>DevPost</a> who taught me how to write high quality web apps that helped cities, colleges, music festivals, governments and tech companies crowdsource innovation. Thousands of developers have participated in hundreds of competitions organized by New York City, Evernote, Samsung, the MTA and the White House.
</p>

<p>
  Before moving to New York, I built social media widgets (remember those?) for Netvibes in Paris. At some point, the CERN was using Netvibes to display some data from the Large Hadron Collider, so I encourage you to jump to the conclusion that I had a substantial role in discovering the Higgs boson.
</p>

<p>
  I also spent a year operating a deep fryer üçü, and I was damn good at it.
</p>

<h2>Side projects</h2>

<p>
  I've also worked on a bunch of side projects over the years. I love being able to build solutions to my own problems! Some highlights:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/projects/cardigans-humility.html">Cardigans Humility</a>: An online version of the Cards Against Humanity game. Pairs well with friends, booze and video chat, especially when quarantined.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/projects/easy-rsvp.html">Easy RSVP</a>: an authentication-less tool to publish events and collect RVSPs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/projects/watchthis.html">WatchThis</a>: a service to help you discover great movies and keep track of the ones you've watched.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/projects/our-band-is-called.html">Our Band Is Called‚Ä¶</a>: a Rock'n'Roll band name generator.
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>
