  I grew up in Paris 🇫🇷, studied in Helsinki 🇫🇮 and now live in New York 🇺🇸 where I lead the fulfillment and logistics software team at <a href="https://www.blueapron.com">Blue Apron</a>. We help deliver hundreds of thousands of boxes of fresh food a week, everywhere in the US. Our work isn't done until we make incredible home cooking accessible to <em>everyone</em>. 📦

<h2>Previous work & side projects</h2>

<p>
  Before Blue Apron, I was leading the development team at <a href='projects/mostro.html'>Mostro</a> where we made infrastructure monitoring software that brought usability and ease of setup to a world of complex, often critical problems.
</p>

<p>
  My first job in New York was with the incredible team at <a href='projects/devpost.html'>DevPost</a> who taught me how to write high quality web apps that helped cities, colleges, music festivals, governments and tech companies crowdsource innovation. Thousands of developers have participated in hundreds of challenges organized by New York City, Evernote, Samsung, the MTA and the White House.
</p>

<p>
  I've also worked on a bunch of side projects over the years. I love being able to build solutions to my own problems! Some highlights:
