<h1>WatchThis</h1>

<p>
  A side project maintained for almost 10 years, <a href="http://www.watchth.is">WatchThis</a> was a website designed to help you discover great movies and keep track of the ones you've watched. It had a recommendation engine and a live-search feature. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/atestu">Alexandre Testu</a> made it look awesome.
