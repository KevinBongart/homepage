<h1>Easy RSVP</h1>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.easy-rsvp.com">Easy RSVP</a> is a homemade solution to the one thing I miss from Facebook: events. It lets you publish an event and makes it super quick and easy for your guests to RSVP. No account required, no email, no password.
</p>

<p>
  It also served as an excuse to do some practical research on authentication-less product design. In light of GDPR, adtech abuse and regular data leaks, I've grown curious about account-less apps or authentication-less features. How useful can you make a web app without requiring any personal information, name, email or password?
